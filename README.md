# coding-problems
This repository contains my solutions for various competitive programming problems.

Main goals:
- Learn C++ / STL
- Improve problem solving skills

The coding style should be understood within a competitive coding context. Throughout the problems it is likely to be inconsistent as I progress, and is often not representitive for the way I code in general.
